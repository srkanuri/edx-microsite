  At SoIC Open edX, we care about the confidentiality and security of your personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information secure in compliance with this Privacy Policy. "Personal Information" is defined below.

<p>
This Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the SoIC Open edX Website (the "Site," which consists of all content and pages located within the www.iudatascience.soic.scholargrid.org web domain) and does not apply to information that we may collect from you in other ways (for example, this policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us over the phone, by fax, or through conventional mail).

</p>
<br>
<p>
  <b>USE FOR PERSONALIZATION AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS</b> <br>
  Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we sometimes present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner's level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.
</p>
